    "A Review of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Applications": "Machine learning is one of the fields in the modern computing world. A plenty of research has been undertaken to make machines intelligent. Learning is a natural human behavior which has been made an essential aspect of the machines as well. There are various techniques devised for the same. Traditional machine learning algorithms have been applied in many application areas. Researchers have put many efforts to improve the accuracy of that machinelearning algorithms. Another dimension was given thought which leads to deep learning concept. Deep learning is a subset of machine learning. So far few applications of deep learning have been explored. This is definitely going to cater to solving issues in several new application domains, sub-domains using deep learning. A review of these past and future application domains, sub-domains, and applications of machine learning and deep learning are illustrated in this paper."
