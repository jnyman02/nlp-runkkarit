    "Small-Footprint Automatic Speech Recognition System using Two-Stage Transfer Learning based Symmetrized Ternary Weight Network": "Traditional automatic speech recognition (ASR) models face challenges when deployed on edge devices due to their high computational requirements and storage demands. To address this issue, we present a novel ASR system specifically designed for edge applications, encompassing both keyword spotting (KWS) and speaker verification (SV) functionalities with on chip learning for speaker registration. Our proposed system employs a compact model trained using a two-stage transfer learning method for on-the-fly small-sample speaker registration. In the proposed model, sparsity-controllable weights are symmetrically ternary-quantized to further exploit data reuse. Additionally, we introduce a Huffman-coding based weight lossy compression method to achieve efficient storage compaction. Moreover, we propose a specialized classifier taking the signal-to-noise ratio into account to enhance the accuracy of SV. The proposed ASR system has been successfully deployed on a 1.65mm 2 custom chip fabricated under 28-nm technology, with only 10.84KB of on-chip memory. This compact system effectively handles KWS and SV tasks, as well as on-chip speaker registration."
